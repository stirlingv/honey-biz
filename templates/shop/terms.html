            <h3>2. Products and Orders</h3>
            <p>
                All orders are subject to availability. We reserve the right to refuse or 
                cancel any order for any reason, including but not limited to product

            </p>

            <h3>3. Pricing</h3>
            <p>
                All prices are listed in US dollars. We reserve the right to change prices 
                at any time without notice. Prices at the time of order placement will be honored.

            <h3>4. Payment</h3>

                Shipping times and methods will be communicated at the time of order. We are

            <h3>6. Bee Nucs (Starter Kits)</h3>
            <p>
                Bee nuc requests are subject to seasonal availability and require coordination 
                for pickup. We will contact you to confirm availability and arrange pickup details. 
                Bee nucs are live animals and are sold as-is with no guarantees beyond our 
                standard health assurances.

            <h3>7. Returns and Refunds</h3>
            <p>

                on a case-by-case basis. Please contact us within 7 days of receiving your order 
                if you have any issues.
